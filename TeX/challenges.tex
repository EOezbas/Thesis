\section{Mechanical and optical challenges}
\label{sub:mechanicalChallenges}

After preparing an orders list according to the previously mentioned circuit design taken from Alphasense \textbf{dokuman} and receiving these components, my first challenge was very clear: Transforming the surface-mount device (SMD) parts into through-hole components. Since I needed the SMD components to test the circuit design I could not design a printed circuit board and solder the components on the board, which would make everything inalterable.
