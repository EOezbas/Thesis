\section{Research}
After deciding to work on this subject, some research on the working principle of Alphasense \chem{NO_2} electrochemical sensor had to be made prior to the initialization of the mechanical and electronical sections of this project. A paper on previous experiments conducted in Boston, United States of America was very helpful to get a first idea about how I could start building my circuit designed for \chem{NO_2} density measurements.
