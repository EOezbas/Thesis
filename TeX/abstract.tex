\chapter*{Abstract}

Scientific data shows that living in locations with a high density of nitrogen dioxide can cause severe damage to human health and result in a lower quality of life. The researches indicate that main reason for \chem{NO_2} emission is mainly caused by burning fossil fuels, industrial processes and especially by motor vehicle exhaust which constitutes approximately 80\% of the total \chem{NO_2} emission in cities. Therefore it is important to track the air pollutant emission to prevent any harm to human health as well as any financial damage.\par 
In this bachelor thesis, it is aimed to design and build a gas measurement sensor unit which tracks and saves voltage data linearly proportional to air pollutant density. The measurement unit is designed for Alphasense 4-electrode B series sensors and is tested with Alphasense NO2-B43F sensor. The hardware section of the circuit is explained in detail as well as the software segment is documented to enable a faster approach to this matter and realization with minimal problems. The results obtained from the sensor unit elicit that it is possible to track and save data concerning \chem{NO_2} measurement within a reasonable margin of error, using minimal resources.
